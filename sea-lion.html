  <h1>Galápagos sea lion</h1>
  <p>
  The Galápagos sea lion is a species of sea lion that is found only in the Galápagos Islands(and a scarce number in Isla de la Plata, Ecuador). They are the smallest sea lion
  species. The scientific name is Zalophus wollebaeki. Some people consider the Galápagos sea lion as a subspecies of Zalophus californianus, or Californian sea lion. But, data
  shows that the Galápagos sea lion is a different species. They belong to the family Otariidae and the genus Zalophus.

  <h1>Physical Attributes</h1>
  <p>
  Galápagos sea lions can range from 1.5 to 2.5 meters in length and weigh 50 to 250 kilograms. The males are larger than the females. When the males are sexually mature, 
  thier sagittal crest gets larger, which makes a little bump on the forehead. A sagittal crest is a section of bone running along the middle of the skull. Adult females and 
  young sea lions don't have this. They have a almost flat head and a small or no forehead. The sea lions have a pointy nose with whiskers, and a long muzzle. Sea lions are 
  often confused for seals.

    <h1>What's the Difference?</h1>
    <h2>Seals vs. Sea Lions</h2>
    One difference between a seal and a sea lion is the ears. Seals have internal ears, so they don't have ear flaps. Sea lions, however, have external ear flaps. Another difference
    is the size of their front flippers or fins. Seals have small and stubby front flippers while sea lions have large ones. A very obvious difference is their noise levels. Sea
    lions are very social and loud. They make noises like the bark of a dog.<br>

    On the other hand, seals are quieter and communicate using soft sounds.<br>

    Seals are also more adapted to living underwater, so they are not able to "walk" on land like sea lions can. Seals' hind flippers angle to the back, and they can't rotate,
    while sea lion's flippers can rotate which is how they move on land. Sea lions are also very social. They are known to play with humans and other sea lions, while seals don't.
    Seals spend their lives mostly alone in the water, only coming up once a year to mate.<br>
